- HEIC Facebook actully converts it, we can rename it from HEIC to JPEG easily on Mac, but apprently that is not that easy on windows, or linux(our server, so I can't simply write code that converts it without processing it), as it's a format made by apple, and unfortunately apple doesnt like to share technology, ha. Apparently there are no solutions built for WordPress alreday, but I'll talk to a few other developers and hear their take!
